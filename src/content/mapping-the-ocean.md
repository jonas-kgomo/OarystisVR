We have a map of our world , 70% of our world is water and this part remains unmapped. Before we go into space we need to understand our limitations , astrobiology is the first thing to study when arriving to a new planet. We know more about the moon than we do about the oceans. Satellite imaging has mapped less than 10% has been mapped sufficiently, that means 65% of the earth is a mystery.

# Bathymetry

Bathymetry means the measurement of depth of water in oceans, seas, or lakes.

Bathymetry data can be used for understanding global ocean currents along with weather and climate. Fishermen use nautical charts with bathymetry for navigation. When you need to accurately enter latitude and longitude coordinates in a GIS, the first step is to give it a datum. A geodetic datum uniquely defines all locations on Earth with coordinates.

# Ocean Data

Sampriti Bhattacharyya, Founder of **Hydroswarm** seeks to solve this kind of problems. Hydroswarm is a robotics company aiming to change that. They’ve developed innovative technologies and new networked systems to enable vast ocean exploration and the collection and analysis of maritime big data.

> “I was an aerospace engineer before and even worked at NASA on flight controls while I was a student at Ohio State. It was only after the Malaysian Airlines MH370 flight got lost that I realized how little we knew about the oceans. What excited me, in so many ways, was the fact that the challenges in deep water exploration are so much more than in space. I suspected our little robots might be able to work together to map larger areas.”

A map contains feature and location data, to do mapping underwater we need a lot of data . Three challenges that hinder mass democratization of mapping the ocean
###  GPS:
### Communication: 
    Bringing the data to the surface is hard under water, and aggregation of and relate the positioning.
### Hardware: 
    The hardware used to collect the data is not scalable. We need to understand enough data to apply sensors that can tell us how healthy are coral reefs.

# Seabed 2030
It aims to bring together all available bathymetric data to produce the definitive map of the world ocean floor by 2030 and make it available to all.

We have maps of Mars that are incredibly detailed with a resolution of 20 meters. But, most of Earth’s seafloor maps are at a resolution of 5 kilometers. The struggle in mapping the seafloor is simple physics: radar cannot reliably scan through deep ocean waters as the radar waves are blocked by the aqueous medium. Instead, sonar is employed from on-board devices carried by ships
