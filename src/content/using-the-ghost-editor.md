We have a map of our world , 70% of our world is water and this part remains unmapped. Before we go into space we need to understand our limitations , astrobiology is the first thing to study when arriving to a new planet. We know more about the moon than we do about the oceans. Satellite imaging has mapped less than 10% has been mapped sufficiently, that means 65% of the earth is a mystery.

# Bathymetry

Bathymetry means the measurement of depth of water in oceans, seas, or lakes.

Bathymetry data can be used for understanding global ocean currents along with weather and climate. Fishermen use nautical charts with bathymetry for navigation. When you need to accurately enter latitude and longitude coordinates in a GIS, the first step is to give it a datum. A geodetic datum uniquely defines all locations on Earth with coordinates.

# Ocean Data

Sampriti Bhattacharyya, Founder of **Hydroswarm** seeks to solve this kind of problems. Hydroswarm is a robotics company aiming to change that. They’ve developed innovative technologies and new networked systems to enable vast ocean exploration and the collection and analysis of maritime big data.

> “I was an aerospace engineer before and even worked at NASA on flight controls while I was a student at Ohio State. It was only after the Malaysian Airlines MH370 flight got lost that I realized how little we knew about the oceans. What excited me, in so many ways, was the fact that the challenges in deep water exploration are so much more than in space. I suspected our little robots might be able to work together to map larger areas.”

###  GPS:
### Communication: 
    Bringing the data to the surface is hard under water, and aggregation of and relate the positioning.
### Hardware: 
    The hardware used to collect the data is not scalable. We need to understand enough data to apply sensors that can tell us how healthy are coral reefs.



A map contains feature and location data, to do mapping underwater we need a lot of data . Three challenges that hinder mass democratization of mapping the ocean
## Adding quotes

When you want to pull out a particularly good excerpt in the middle of a piece, you can use `>` at the beginning of a paragraph to turn it into a Blockquote. You might've seen this formatting before in email clients.

> A well placed quote guides a reader through a story, helping them to understand the most important points being made

All themes handles blockquotes slightly differently. Sometimes they'll look better kept shorter, while other times you can quote fairly hefty amounts of text and get away with it. Generally, the safest option is to use blockquotes sparingly.


## Dividing things up

If you're writing a piece in parts and you just feel like you need to divide a couple of sections distinctly from each other, a horizontal rule might be just what you need. Dropping `---` on a new line will create a sleek divider, anywhere you want it.
