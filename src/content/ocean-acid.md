> Ocean Acidification
Ocean Acidification is causing coral reefs to be less resilient to Climate Change
A changing climate is altering oceans in major ways and coral reefs around the planet may not be able to adapt to survive.

Ocean acidification (OA) occurs when carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is absorbed by seawater, resulting in a chemical reaction that reduces pH and calcium carbonate levels vital for the growth and repair of calcifying organisms like coral, explains the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association.

At least one-quarter of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from coal, oil and gas dissolves in the ocean, according to the Smithsonian Institute.

Oceans are in fact largely great blue deserts. Occupying less than one percent of the ocean floor, coral reefs are home to more than twenty-five percent of marine life. And 90% of all ocean life is found in coastal waters.

Acid and Bleaching
The ocean is getting warmer and more acidic, posing a two-pronged assault on coral.

In a process called bleaching, higher temperatures stress coral, which evict the colorful algae that live in them and provide them with food. The bleached coral often die afterward. And if that wasn’t enough, dissolved carbon dioxide creates more acidic water, which hinders the coral’s ability to build their iconic limestone skeletons. Heat, rather than acidity, currently poses the greater threat.

# Permafrost
Permafrost is any ground that remains completely frozen (0°C) or colder—for at least two years straight. These permanently frozen grounds are most common in regions with high mountains and in Earth’s higher latitudes—near the North and South Poles.

Permafrost is indeed thawing—at higher latitudes and to greater depths than ever before. In various parts of Siberia the active layer above permafrost can thaw to a depth of 50 centimeters every summer. Human viruses from even further back could also make a showing. The likelihood and frequency of outbreaks similar to the one in Siberia will depend on the speed and trajectory of climate change.

# Yukitia
Prehistoric diseases could be resurrected from woolly mammoth remains.

> “Anthrax spores can stay alive in the permafrost for up to 2,500 years. That’s scary given the thawing of animal burial grounds from the 19th century,” said Boris Kershengolts, a Yakutsk biologist who studies northern climates. “When they are taken out of the permafrost and put into our temperatures, they revive.”

Global warming has already been linked to the first outbreak of anthrax in the Arctic region of Yamal in 70 years.

Some even fear that “paleo-pathogens” - prehistoric diseases that humans may have never encountered - could be released, after live bacteria was found in mammoth remains frozen for 20,000 yrs.
