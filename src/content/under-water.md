# Sunken Aqua-Musea

There are some places we cannot all traverse as a human species , the underwater is one such voyage. Using VR (virtual reality) we are able to do extreme tourism, that is underwater territory . Oaristys VR is a digital recreation of the Underwater Museum, and some of the artefacts inside it. Sunken cities aways have a strange feeling as a fiction but offer great stories that appeal to many, and thus can draw attention to the world that is around us. When we submerge statues into the deep oceanic blue we are often confronted with a subliminal terrace—greeting us with a passionate welcome to study its placidity.

Say you’re a 14-year-old kid from the city, and you’ve never seen the ocean. And instead of getting taken to the natural history museum or an aquarium, you get taken out to the ocean, to an underwater Noah’s Ark, which you can access through a dry-glass viewing tunnel, where you can see all the wildlife of the land be colonized by the wildlife of the ocean. Clearly, it would blow your mind. Jason deCaire

The aim of Oarystis is to be that VR glass that allows us to rewire the human condition to climate change issues. We are more inclined to be concerned about this issues if we our role in them is made obvious. We will be able to showcase this results where ever people are, the viewer does not have to at the Pacific Ocean banks to understand the current state of the environment.

# Underwater Museums

We take exhisting scultpures submerged in various locations in the world, and display them in a virtual environment. In a computer generated world it is possible to recreate the desired world with permmisible accuracy

# Coral Reefs

In many of these worlds we place coral reefs that are also procedurally generated , for example with Houdini.

# Museo Subacuático de Arte (MUSA)
Taylor’s masterpieces also lie at the heart of an installation located between Cancún and Isla Mujeres in Mexico. In an effort to repair some of the region’s damaged coral reef, the artist partnered with the country’s Environment and Natural Resources Secretariat to open an artificial habitat where sea life could settle and thrive.

# Underwater sculpture, Key Largo, Florida

When we consider delicate underwater worlds , fascades of the physical world seem to be unveiled, space-time is removed from the front cortex of our imagination and sculptures begin to form new artifacts based on biofouling. Taking advantage of these quality of water which rejects form and is universal , unlike countries which have vast differences and borders, we seek to draw narratives that are universal.
